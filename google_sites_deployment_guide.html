2. Click on the "+" button to create a new site
3. Name your site (e.g., "Teacher Professional Development - Building Relationships")
4. Choose a theme that matches the professional look of the materials

## Step 2: Prepare Your Files
1. Extract the teacher_pd_html.zip file on your computer
2. You'll see all the HTML files organized in the teacher_pd_html folder

## Step 3: Create Site Structure
Create the following pages on your Google Site to match the organization of the materials:
1. Home (main page)
2. Activities
3. Resources
4. Materials
5. About

## Step 4: Upload HTML Content
For each page:
1. Click on the page where you want to add content
2. Click the "Embed" button (looks like "</>" in the right sidebar)
3. Select "Embed code"
4. Open the corresponding HTML file from your extracted folder
5. Copy the content between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags
6. Paste this content into the embed code field
7. Click "Next" and then "Insert"

## Step 5: Set Up Navigation

2. Choose your preferred URL (if available)
3. Set appropriate sharing settings (public or restricted to your organization)
4. Click "Publish" to make your site live

## Alternative Approach: Using Google Drive
If embedding HTML doesn't work well with Google Sites, you can:
1. Upload all HTML files to Google Drive
2. Make them publicly accessible (or accessible to your target audience)
3. Create links on your Google Site that point to these files in Google Drive

## Tips for Google Sites
- Use the "Themes" panel to customize colors and fonts to match the professional development materials
- Add a site logo if you have one
- Use the "Insert" menu to add images, buttons, and other elements to enhance your pages
- Preview your site regularly to ensure it looks good on different devices
