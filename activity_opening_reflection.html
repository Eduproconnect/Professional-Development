                <h1>Opening Activity: Teacher Who Made a Difference</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>To connect participants with their own experiences as students and identify effective relationship-building practices through personal reflection.</p>
<h2>Time Required</h2>
<p>30 minutes</p>
<h2>Materials Needed</h2>
<ul>
<li>This handout</li>
<li>Pen or pencil</li>
<li>Sticky notes (3 per participant)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Individual Reflection (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>Think about a teacher who made a positive impact on your life. This could be from any point in your educational journeyâ€”elementary school through college or beyond. Reflect on the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who was this teacher? (Name and subject/grade level)</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>What specific actions did this teacher take that made you feel valued, seen, or supported?</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<ol>
<li>How did this teacher make you feel? What emotions do you associate with this teacher?</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<hr />
<ol>
<li>What lasting impact did this teacher have on you? How did they influence your:</li>
<li>Academic development? <strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong>______</li>
<li>Personal growth? <strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong>____</li>
<li>
<p>Career choices? <strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong><strong><em>_</em></strong>_____</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What qualities or characteristics made this teacher effective?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<hr />
<h3>Part 2: Partner Discussion (10 minutes)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Find a partner you don't know well.</li>
<li>Take turns sharing about your influential teacher (3-4 minutes each).</li>
<li>As you listen to your partner, note similarities and differences in your experiences.</li>
<li>Together, identify 3 key relationship-building practices that were present in both of your experiences.</li>
<li>Write each practice on a separate sticky note.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 3: Whole Group Synthesis (10 minutes)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Post your sticky notes on the designated wall chart.</li>
<li>As a whole group, we'll organize these practices into categories.</li>
<li>We'll discuss patterns and common themes that emerge.</li>
<li>We'll connect these personal experiences to research on teacher-student relationships.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>How do your experiences as a student inform your approach as a teacher?</li>
<li>What relationship-building practices from your influential teacher do you already use?</li>
<li>What practices would you like to incorporate more intentionally?</li>
<li>How might your students describe you years from now?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remember</h2>
<p>The teachers who impact us most profoundly often do so through seemingly small actions that communicate genuine care and belief in our potential. As you reflect on the teacher who made a difference in your life, consider how you might be that teacher for your current and future students.</p>
