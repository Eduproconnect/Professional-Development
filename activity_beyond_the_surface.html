                <h1>Activity Handout: Beyond the Surface - Case Studies</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>To practice looking beyond surface behaviors to understand the whole child and develop appropriate responses that build relationships.</p>
<h2>Time Required</h2>
<p>45 minutes</p>
<h2>Materials Needed</h2>
<ul>
<li>This handout with case studies</li>
<li>Chart paper</li>
<li>Markers</li>
<li>Sticky notes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Case Study Analysis (25 minutes)</h3>
<ol>
<li>In your small group, read your assigned case study carefully.</li>
<li>Discuss the following questions:</li>
<li>What might be happening beneath the surface for this student?</li>
<li>What "single stories" might we be telling ourselves about this student?</li>
<li>What strengths might this student possess that aren't immediately obvious?</li>
<li>What questions could we ask to learn more about this student's context?</li>
<li>
<p>What relationship-building strategies might be effective with this student?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On chart paper, create a visual representation of:</p>
</li>
<li>What we see (observable behaviors)</li>
<li>What might be beneath the surface (possible contexts, needs, strengths)</li>
<li>Potential approaches for connection</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Gallery Walk and Feedback (10 minutes)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Post your chart paper on the wall.</li>
<li>Half of your group will stay with your poster to explain your insights.</li>
<li>The other half will rotate to view other groups' work.</li>
<li>Use sticky notes to add additional ideas or questions to each poster.</li>
<li>Switch roles halfway through so everyone has a chance to see other groups' work.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 3: Whole Group Synthesis (10 minutes)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Return to your seats for whole-group discussion.</li>
<li>Each group will share one key insight from their case study.</li>
<li>We'll identify common themes and strategies across all case studies.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Case Studies</h2>
<h3>Case Study 1: Marcus</h3>
<p>Marcus is a 7th grader who consistently arrives late to your first-period class. When he does arrive, he often puts his head down and refuses to participate. His homework is rarely completed, and when you try to speak with him about it, he responds with shrugs or one-word answers. Other teachers have labeled him as "unmotivated" and "checked out." His academic performance is well below grade level, though you've noticed he's quite articulate when discussing topics that interest him, like basketball or video games.</p>
<h3>Case Study 2: Sophia</h3>
<p>Sophia is a 4th grader who excels academically but has frequent emotional outbursts in class. She becomes extremely frustrated when she makes mistakes and will sometimes tear up her work or refuse to continue. She has high standards for herself and becomes visibly anxious before tests or presentations. She has few friends and often spends recess alone, reading or drawing. When you try to discuss her emotions with her, she becomes defensive and says everything is "fine."</p>
<h3>Case Study 3: Jamal</h3>
<p>Jamal is a 10th grader who is charismatic and popular with his peers. He's clearly bright and can be engaged in class discussions, but he rarely completes written assignments and is failing most of his classes. He frequently disrupts class with jokes and off-topic comments. When redirected, he can become confrontational, saying things like "This class is boring" or "When am I ever going to use this?" The principal has suggested he might have a learning disability, but his parents have resisted testing.</p>
<h3>Case Study 4: Elena</h3>
<p>Elena is a 2nd grader who recently immigrated from Guatemala. She speaks very little English and sits quietly in class, rarely participating. She seems to be trying to follow along, but her work shows little comprehension. Other students sometimes make fun of her accent when she does try to speak. You've noticed she's often wearing the same clothes, and she doesn't bring lunch or money for lunch. When you've tried to communicate with her parents, they haven't responded to notes or phone calls.</p>
<h3>Case Study 5: Tyler</h3>
<p>Tyler is a 12th grader who was once a high achiever but has recently shown a significant decline in performance. He's started skipping classes, and when present, he seems distracted and tired. His appearance has changedâ€”he's lost weight and often wears the same clothes multiple days in a row. When you've expressed concern, he's become defensive and said he's "just stressed about college applications." Other teachers have suggested he might be using drugs, but you're not sure.</p>
<h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>How did this activity challenge your initial assumptions about student behavior?</li>
<li>What strategies emerged that could be applied to students in your own classroom?</li>
<li>How might understanding context change your response to challenging behaviors?</li>
<li>What resources or support would help you better understand your students' contexts?</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: Looking beyond surface behaviors is not about making excuses for students but about understanding the whole child so we can respond effectively and build meaningful relationships.</p>
