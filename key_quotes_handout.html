                <h1>Handout: Key Quotes and Insights from Research Sources</h1>
<p>This reference guide compiles powerful quotes and insights from the various sources explored in our professional development session. Use these for reflection, discussion with colleagues, or as inspiration in your classroom.</p>
<h2>From "Dead Poets Society" and Parker Palmer's Analysis</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Real learning does not happen until students are brought into relationship with the teacher, with each other, and with the subject."
— Parker Palmer</p>
<p>"Students will often say that their favorite teachers overcome the students' fear of meeting this stranger that binds subject and teacher."
— Parker Palmer</p>
<p>"A learning space to Palmer should be designed with hospitality in mind."
— Parker Palmer</p>
<p>"Good teaching cannot be reduced to technique. Good teaching comes from the identity and integrity of the teacher."
— Parker Palmer</p>
<p>"I stand being here because I love teaching."
— Mr. Keating, Dead Poets Society</p>

<h2>From "Cause I Ain't Got a Pencil" by Joshua T. Dickerson</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"I woke myself up
Because we ain't got an alarm clock.
Dug in the dirty clothes basket,
'Cause ain't nobody washed my uniform.
Brushed my hair and teeth in the dark,
'Cause the lights ain't on.
Even got my baby sister ready,
'Cause my mama wasn't home.
Got us both to school on time
To eat us a good breakfast.
Then when I got to class the teacher fussed
'Cause I ain't got no pencil."
— Joshua T. Dickerson</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>From "Because I Had a Teacher" by Kobi Yamada</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Because I had a teacher, I have whole new worlds to explore."
— Kobi Yamada</p>
<p>"Because I had a teacher, I know how good it feels when someone is happy to see me."
— Kobi Yamada</p>
<p>"Because I had a teacher, I learned that mistakes are just part of learning."
— Kobi Yamada</p>
<p>"Because I had a teacher, I discovered that I can do much more than I thought I could."
— Kobi Yamada</p>
<p>"Because I had a teacher, I see that some of the most important things are said without words."
— Kobi Yamada</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>From Rita Pierson's TED Talk "Every Kid Needs a Champion"</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Every child deserves an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection, and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be."
— Rita Pierson</p>
<p>"Kids don't learn from people they don't like."
— Rita Pierson</p>
<p>"They don't pay me to like the kids. They pay me to teach a lesson. I'll teach the lesson. I'll teach it well, but I don't have to like the kids." "Kids can tell the difference between adults who like them and adults who don't."
— Rita Pierson, quoting a colleague and her response</p>
<p>"Teaching and learning should bring joy. How powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks, who were not afraid to think, and who had a champion? Every child deserves a champion."
— Rita Pierson</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>From Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's TED Talk "The Danger of a Single Story"</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story."
— Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</p>
<p>"The consequence of the single story is this: It robs people of dignity. It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult. It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar."
— Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</p>
<p>"Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize."
— Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>From Angela Duckworth's TED Talk "Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance"</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality."
— Angela Duckworth</p>
<p>"We have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned."
— Angela Duckworth</p>
<p>"Talent doesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments."
— Angela Duckworth</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>From Josh Shipp's Motivational Content</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Every kid is one caring adult away from being a success story."
— Josh Shipp</p>
<p>"Kids listen to our actions, NOT our words."
— Josh Shipp</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>From Films About Teaching</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"How can you reach me if you don't even see me?"
— Student in Dangerous Minds</p>
<p>"I am their teacher. I am supposed to teach them. That's my job."
— Erin Gruwell, Freedom Writers</p>
<p>"I don't want them to fail. I don't want to fail them."
— Stacey Bess, Beyond the Blackboard</p>
<p>"They say you don't make a difference until you see the difference in the eyes of your students."
— Ron Clark, The Ron Clark Story</p>
